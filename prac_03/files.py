# 1. Write code that asks the user for their name, then opens a file called "name.txt" and writes that name to it.
# Remember to close your file.
# name = input("Name: ")
# with open("name.txt", "w") as out_file:
#     print(name, file=out_file)

# 2 (In the same file, but as if it were a separate program) Write code that opens "name.txt" and reads the name (as
# above) then prints, "Your name is Bob" (or whatever the name is in the file).
# with open("name.txt", "r") as in_file:
#     for line in in_file:
#         print(f"Your name is {line}")
