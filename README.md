# CP1404 Practicals

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

### Brief Information about Repository and Me:

I am current student studying IT@JCU. This repository covers new topics and tasks on a weekly basis, aiming to improve
my coding skills. This will be done by learning and practicing the university programming patterns to further develop
clean code.

### 3 main lessons I have learned about clean code:

1. Don't Repeat Yourself Principles (DRY)
2. Look Before You Leap vs Easier to Ask For Forgiveness than Permission
3. Give functions short and concise tasks
